# Localle-Network
A Decentralized Payment Network for Local Currencies
Source Mining Solutions, LLC (current name of our tentative entity) is a financial technology company that dedicates itself to alleviating economic deprivation and inequity through the applied use of Blockchain technology and social entrepreneurship.

In that mission, we plan to build an ecosystem of products that will be able to assist communities both virtual and physical in using communal economics to empower their ideas, and grow their own respective economies. This will be akin to a decentralized commercial banking system that is very lightly owned and operated by our company.

Localle Network Overview

Introduction to Communal Economics:

Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETs)
An exchange trading system, or local currency, is a community based currency aimed at increasing an area’s economic activity by encouraging spending money at participating small businesses within a predetermined region. Often facilitated by non-government organizations, city governments, and national currency issuers, they increase their adoption by either being offered as reward for contributions to the community, or as incentive for its use (for example discounts at participating stores). The most prominent version of the idea is pretty simple. (This is from an earlier version of the project)

Issuers trade their currency for the national currency at an artificially set rate, for example $1.00 in exchange for 1.10 KC Dollars which amounts to a 10% increase in purchasing power. Effectively, this creates a 5% discount. Rates are set by the issuer and the redemption of the currency for USD effectively retracts this increase in purchasing power. Commerce is kept locally and businesses and people are incentivized to keep commerce local. There are other models for community currencies, which will eventually be made available through the platform.

The Problem:
Increased globalization has created a largely unconnected network of pockets of inequality all around the world and outflux of capital from small communities to big box/online retailers and large franchises. Communities for decades have used local currencies as a means to revitalize, build communal wealth, and extend their collective purchasing power. Existing systems however have made it difficult to cultivate and manage these networks as they require, among other things, manpower and management fees to controls for  the trade, management,  ledger accuracy, counterfeiting etc. 

In addition payment processors often exacerbate the problem by imposing fees that are eventually passed on to the customer at the time of purchase. These fees are often sent to multinational corporations who have no interest in reinvesting those funds locally. 

The Solution:
A Blockchain based platform that allows for the funding, issuance, and management of stable/asset-backed currencies. This would include a web-based wallet with multi-currency support that is accessible to both consumers and merchants accepting the currencies as payment (as a supplemental POS system).  Though the main staple of the platform will include a mobile wallet app, similar to other crypto-currency wallets (Coinbase, Crypto.com, Wirex, Colu) and traditional peer-to-peer wallets (Cash App, Venmo, Zelle) but user friendly to the average shopper, to facilitate the trade and redemption of the currencies created. The mobile app will also include a map of local shops accepting the currency as payment.


In addition we hope these communities and currencies would be able to organize themselves in a Decentralized Autonomous Organization where they could collectively manage updates to the system and determine where treasury assets, funded by processing fees within their currency and other revenue generating assets, are allocated. 
Eventually we would like to see a dApp that would allow for issuance from the issuance contract/ wallet and entities involved in the issuance as well as a dashboard, similar to that shown in the Kenyan CIC networks (see additional resources), for data analysis and macroeconomic view of the system. 

Other products:

Yield Farming/Liquidity Mining. These are smart contracts that earn interest for investors that lock their capital up to be used for liquidity in the Decentralized Finance space. Interest is earned by lending assets to those using DeFi products (MakerDAO, Compound, AAVE, etc.) to borrow the equivalent of “hard money” loans from the open market. In addition they provide liquidity for trading pairs on Decentralized Exchanges (UniSwap, KyberNetwork, etc) and earn interest as 100% of the trading fees are distributed amongst token holders. Each DAO’s treasury will utilize this platform to grow their collective holdings and redistribute the value in ways that align with their goals. (Currently in Development) 

Our protocol will add to the space by creating a system, similar to pickle.finance, that would farm stablecoins only in an attempt to move them closer to their peg. This will not only be a useful tool for the overall DeFi space but also allow for communities to have a protocol that could eventually ensure their stablecoins keep their 1:1 value without the need for bank partnerships, tax incentives, or complicated ecosystems of collaboration between issuers and businesses. The fees from the protocol should be distributed among token holders, and provide liquidity for the local currencies. 

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. (DAO)  These are smart contracts that allow for the management and trustless organization of communal organizations both virtual and otherwise. Our company will work in launching, managing, and contributing to a number of online and off-line community driven organizations by providing liquidity for the exchange of their underlying governance tokens  and holding no more than a 10%. Anyone can make a proposal on anything they deem worthy to the group. Funds locked in the organization’s contract (treasury) and members collectively decide on how to use the funds to expand or develop. Contributors to the currency earn governance tokens by contributing to the treasury. Treasury funds are used to yield farm and liquidity mine in the smart contract and earn interest for the DAOs overall purchasing power to increase. Contributions are always redeemable 1:1 at any time. (1st DAO is currently in Development)
